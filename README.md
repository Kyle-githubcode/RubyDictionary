<p>
Dictionary uses an SQL database to connect definitions with words. </p>
<p>Words containing the same definition are listed as synonyms, this means definitions appearing under more than one word can be edited at the same time.</p>
<p>Dicitonary can be searched by word name and updated either by individual word or by csv file</p>
<p>Multiple definitions of the same word are allowed during the csv import. New definitions can also be added to a word by creating a word with the same name but with the new definition</p>
